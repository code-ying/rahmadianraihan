'Life is like a roller coaster, full of twists, turns, ups, and downs.'

Hi, My name is Muhammad Raihan Rahmadian. Life is like a roller coaster, full of twists, turns, ups, and downs. Just like when you ride a roller coaster, there are times when life feels thrilling and exhilarating, and there are times when it feels scary and uncertain.



Sometimes you'll feel on top of the world, and in other condition you'll feel downward.



It's very important to us as human being to have highs and lows in expectation, because sometimes if we fall to the bottom, we can fight back and win it. When life throws you for a loop, hold on tight and stay grounded.

### "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game."– Babe Ruth

Just like when you in a roller coaster, holding can help you more secure and stable during turbulent times.

I've got some advice from a wise man, he said i should enjoy the ride of the life.



Despite the twists and turns, life can be incredibly beautiful, exciting, and amazing. Like i said before, just like the roller coaster's way, try to enjoy your ride and appreciate every moments of joy and exhilaration.

Take your time to celebrate your small victories and achievments, and cherish the moments with your bestfriend. We all know that we have something to be afraid of, like speed and heights that identically to roller coaster. I think it's kinda similar in life like facing the challenges and uncertainties.



### "Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."– Thomas A. Edison

But we have to conquering our fear, facing our fears, so we can lead ourselves to personal growth and self-discovery.

I'm a moslem, in my religion, we do believe with the designer, the creator, the only one above, that is god. Before we get in to roller coaster, we do personally believe that roller coaster is safe and enjoyable, we have to put our trusts to the engineers that create the roller coaster. Similarly, we have to trust to god that has a plan for you, even when things seem chaotic or out of our control.



My advice for all the readers is just to trust in yourself, trust in your journey, never stop the ride you have been on, and trust everything will work out in the end.

I was studying international relations in the university, i don't know how can i learn about history, geopolitics, and kinda things i've never been excited before.


### "The purpose of our lives is to be happy."- Dalai Lama

But look at me now!, i've graduated from the university, i was happy and grateful at the moment, but it's only a temporary feeling because i know i will fight for the real life, real world and i realize it's gonna be so hard to get a job related to this study.

Because of that condition, my brain was told me that i have to learn new things, that will continue to exist in a long term of period.

### So i am doing my research with the mission 'what is the skills that i have to learn?'

Based on that questions, i decided to learn software engineering, especially front-end development that related to web design and web development
